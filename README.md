# Tipping Points
Mobile strategy game about balancing tipping points in a C21 world

## Intro
Pandemic, climate change, capitalism, habitat and biodiversity loss, media control, inequality, pollution. All these are linked, and a change in one place ripples through the rest. Brief is deliberately broad at the moment to encourage but the broad idea is to create a strategy game inspired by mechanics like Football Manager and Pandemic that multiple devs/etc can contribute to.

## Contributions
Actively encouraged. At prototyping stage high-level gameplay ideas are requested, perhaps in the form of: READMEs; paper sketches; etc.
