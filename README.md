# Tipping Points
Mobile developer Paul Ledger suggested in [this Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/Flexicoder/status/1248929526542938113) that  it would benefit the dev community to work on a collaborative project whilst in Covid-19 lockdown. This is my suggestion for that project: a mobile strategy game about balancing tipping points in a C21 world.

## Abstract
Pandemic, climate change, capitalism, habitat and biodiversity loss, media control, inequality, pollution. All these are linked, and a change in one place ripples through the rest. The brief is deliberately broad so as to encourage collaboration but the broad idea is to create a strategy game inspired by mechanics like Football Manager and Pandemic that multiple devs/etc can contribute to.

## Contributions
PULL REQUESTS STRONGLY ENCOURAGED! It's kind of the whole point. At prototyping stage high-level gameplay ideas are requested, perhaps in the form of: READMEs; paper sketches; etc.
